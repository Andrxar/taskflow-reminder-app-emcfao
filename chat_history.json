This includes the Russian language input fields for task details, date and time pickers, and \"Save\" and \"Delete\" buttons.\n*   **Tabbed Interface:** Create the two tabs: \"Active Reminders\" and \"Completed Reminders.\" Initially, focus on displaying dummy data in each tab to establish the layout.\n*   **Reminder Display and Postponement:** Design the reminder notification that appears when a task is due. Include the reminder text and the quick selection options for postponing (5min, 10min, 15min, 30min, 1 hour, 1 day).\n\n**Design Elements:**\n\n*   **Colors:**\n    *   Base color: Light gray or off-white for a clean background.\n    *   Primary text color: Dark gray or black for readability.\n    *   Accent colors: A calming blue or green for buttons and highlights.\n    *   Highlight shades: Lighter shades of the accent color for interactive elements.\n*   **Typography:**\n    *   Use a modern and clean sans-serif font like \"Roboto\" or \"Open Sans\" for the Russian text.\n\nLet's create an elegant and functional mobile app!\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-09-29T05:31:12.119735"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you create a comprehensive reminder application for Android with Russian language support and all the features you requested.
